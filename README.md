# Algorithm Practice
This repo was created to practice some of the common algorithm questions you encounter during tech interviews.
<br />
Algorithm is hard! And I personally struggle a lot when trying to understand the concept & approach.

So in this repo, I go over common algo problems IN DEPTH. 
<br />
Each file has its own problem, with detailed explanation that includes
general concept, summary of the problem, examples, detailed approach,
<br />
and step by step explanation for each line of code with actual implementation.
